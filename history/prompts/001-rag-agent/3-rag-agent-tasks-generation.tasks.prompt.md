# PHR: RAG Agent Tasks Generation

## Prompt

```
generate tasks be concise
```

## Response

Generated comprehensive tasks.md for the RAG Agent feature based on existing specifications. The tasks are organized by user story priority and include:

- Phase 1: Setup tasks for project initialization
- Phase 2: Foundational tasks for the RAG agent structure
- Phase 3: US1 tasks for basic RAG functionality
- Phase 4: US2 tasks for follow-up query handling
- Phase 5: US3 tasks for Qdrant integration
- Phase 6: Polish and cross-cutting concerns

The tasks follow the required checklist format with sequential IDs, user story labels, and clear file paths. Each task is specific enough for an LLM to complete without additional context. The implementation strategy includes MVP scope focusing on US1 (basic RAG functionality) and incremental delivery approach.
