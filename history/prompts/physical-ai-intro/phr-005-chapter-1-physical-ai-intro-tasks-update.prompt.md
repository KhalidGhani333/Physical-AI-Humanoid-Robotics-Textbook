$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

The task list for "Chapter 1 Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" has been successfully regenerated and updated based on the revised plan. The `tasks.md` file now focuses purely on content generation, testing, and CLI automation, with all frontend/backend tasks removed. The task count has been adjusted to 20, with parallel execution opportunities and an MVP scope defined. A PHR for this update has also been created.

## Outcome

- 🧪 Tests: Test creation tasks are included for each user story.
- 📁 Files: 1 file updated: tasks.md
