## Prompt

Generate Chapter 2: Foundations of Embodied Intelligence.
structure : chapter 2 divides into 3 file like chapter-2/part1.md,part2.md,part3.md
Focus: Perception–planning–control loop, physics basics (force, torque, friction), and humanoid architecture.
Audience: Students new to robotics.
Success: 4+ examples, sim-to-real gap explained, 2–3 simple diagrams.
Constraints: 3000–4000 words, Markdown, no tools (ROS/Gazebo) and no heavy math.
Scope: Embodied cognition, dynamics basics; No controller code.

## Response snapshot

The specification for Chapter 2: Foundations of Embodied Intelligence has been created in `specs/002-chapter-2-embodied-intelligence/spec.md`. All quality checklist items have passed.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully generated the feature specification and validated it against the quality checklist.
- 🧪 Tests: All spec quality checklist items passed.
- 📁 Files: Created `specs/002-chapter-2-embodied-intelligence/spec.md` and `specs/002-chapter-2-embodied-intelligence/checklists/requirements.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user can now proceed with `/sp.plan` to generate the implementation plan.
- 🧠 Reflection: The spec generation was successful, and all constraints and requirements from the user prompt were addressed.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: `create-phr.sh` script did not return expected JSON output, requiring manual PHR creation. This may indicate an issue with the script's execution environment or its JSON output.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Investigate the `create-phr.sh` script to ensure it consistently returns JSON output.
